## Visualizing Government Debt

### Flourish chart 2 
To make this chart, I trimmed the data to include only those countries that had data available in 2007 and 2019. I calculated which of these experienced the greatest change in GDP to debt ratio, and visualized only those that had greater than average change. I included the OECD average for context. While I like the way it looks, the format requires that the number of countries depicted be smaller, otherwise it looked like a confusing mess - if it were important that all of the countries be shown, or that the timeframe go back to the 90s, I would not have chosen this style. My other considerations (besides which countries to trim) when making this chart were about colors. Specifically, I wondered if the countries with the highest ratios also needed to be colored differently, or if they stand out enough without extra color. Ultimately, I decided that the additional color does help show the highest value (Japan) more boldly, but it is most important for the benchmark information that helps contextualize the reader: the line for the US and the OECD average.
