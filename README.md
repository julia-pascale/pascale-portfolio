# about me 🐶 🎸 🏙️
#### Julia Pascale (she/her): Master's student in Public Policy and Management, Non-Profit and Public Finance concentration
**Hi! I'm Julia.** I am in Pittsburgh, where I have lived since I graduated from college in 2016, but I'm from New York. Before I started grad school, I worked in affordable housing for [City of Bridges Community Land Trust](https://www.cityofbridgesclt.org) for 4 years, and I'm currently also a research analyst at [Fourth Economy](https://www.fourtheconomy.com). 
When I am not working, I'm either playing guitar, walking my dog on the [north shore trail](https://goo.gl/maps/Dqki8Hg6V6tDR8kC8), or playing guitar for my dog. 

# what I hope to learn 📝
I hope to learn how to make data visualizations that look cool and help people process important information quickly. When I graduate I want to use these skills to inform advocacy and decision-making for mission-based organizations.
