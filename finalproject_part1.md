## final project - part one

#### intro

Housing affordability and access to safe, quality housing are problems of an astounding scale, and their negative impacts bleed into so many areas of life - healthcare, food access, schools, infrastructure, work - there's a reason that "Housing First" has become a refrain in social services. More information about Housing First can be found [here](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/) with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Ensuring that people have access to safe and stable housing should be the first step, and it has powerful downstream effects for our other services. For example, giving people housing can save tens of thousands of dollars in emergency room costs per year. (Sturtevant & Viveiros, 2016) <br>

Evictions are one way that people can be housing insecure, and even when evictions don't lead to homelessness, eviction itself is a traumatic experience that has many negative impacts. The story my project will tell is about evictions in Allegheny County, and how they correlate with rent and property values increasing, how they impact other social services, and how landlords are more likely to evict children and Black people. 

### visualizations and sketches

SKETCH OF STORYBOARD GOES HERE

The story will begin with a chart of evictions over time. 

Then I will show the change in property values over time in Allegheny County zip codes that have a lot of evictions (I still need to figure out how I will define "a lot" by going through the data). 

I will also show race and eviction, as well as a map of neighborhoods that have a lot of evictions alongside Pittsburgh's original redlining map. This is not an original idea, but I will recreate the visual because I think it will be good, doable practice in GIS, and I think it's really powerful storytelling. 


I'll make another line chart to show evictions in areas that have a lot of children (same "a lot" caveat as above) and write a narrative about the impacts of eviction on children.

I will end the story with some stacked bars that show what happens when people aren't getting evicted. I'll use 211 calls data to tell this part of the story, and the viewer will see the types of calls that occurred during the eviction moratorium.

The call to action will be to create a push for a comprehensive eviction diversion program, like [the one that exists in Philadelphia](https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/About), which requires landlords to participate in mediation before evicting their tenants.
