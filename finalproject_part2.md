## final project - evictions in Allegheny County - part two - draft of storyboard, user feedback

### intro 
(this is the same as part one)
The lack of housing affordability and access to safe, quality housing in America are problems of an astounding scale, and their negative impacts bleed into so many areas of life - healthcare, food access, schools, infrastructure, work - there's a reason that "Housing First" has become a refrain in social services. More information about Housing First can be found [here](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/) with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Ensuring that people have access to safe and stable housing should be the first step, and it has powerful downstream effects for our other services. For example, giving people housing can save tens of thousands of dollars in emergency room costs per year. (Sturtevant & Viveiros, 2016) <br>

Evictions are one way that people can be housing insecure, and even when evictions don't lead to homelessness, eviction itself is a traumatic experience that has many negative impacts. The story my project will tell is about evictions in Allegheny County, and how they correlate with rent and property values increasing, how they impact other social services, and how landlords are more likely to evict children and Black people. 

### visualizations and sketches

The story will begin with a line chart of evictions in Allegheny County over time.

## Property owners who have sold houses in the Allegheny County zip codes that have the most eviction filings have enjoyed an average appreciation of 137% since 2010.

(15221, 15235, 15146, 15206, 15202, 15205, 15212, 15236, 15025, 15210.) 

## The average landlord who filed for eviction in these zip codes did so five times between 2009 and 2018. This is certainly an undercount, as many of them own properties in different names and LLCs.

I will end the story with some stacked bars that show 211 calls over time. This is a great proxy for need, because 211 is the phone line people can call to get immediate help with social services.

The call to action will be to create a push for a comprehensive eviction diversion program, like [the one that exists in Philadelphia](https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/About), which requires landlords to participate in mediation before evicting their tenants. *Must find data about eviction outcomes in Philly! <br>  

#### how many people get evicted?
![1 in 17](/IMG_5570.jpg) <br>  

"As the figures above show, our current data suggest there was roughly 1 eviction filing for every 17 renter households between 2000 and 2016. Approximately 1 in 40 renter households were evicted over this period. To put these numbers into perspective, at the peak of the financial crisis in 2010, estimates suggest slightly over one million foreclosures were completed nationally. By comparison, we see almost a million evictions against tenants every single year." (Eviction Lab) [source link](https://evictionlab.org/national-estimates/) <br>
