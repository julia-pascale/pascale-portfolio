## final project - evictions in Allegheny County - part two - draft of storyboard, user feedback

### intro 
(this is the same as part one)
The lack of housing affordability and access to safe, quality housing in America are problems of an astounding scale, and their negative impacts bleed into so many areas of life - healthcare, food access, schools, infrastructure, work - there's a reason that "Housing First" has become a refrain in social services. More information about Housing First can be found [here](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/housing-first/) with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Ensuring that people have access to safe and stable housing should be the first step, and it has powerful downstream effects for our other services. For example, giving people housing can save tens of thousands of dollars in emergency room costs per year. (Sturtevant & Viveiros, 2016) <br>

Evictions are one way that people can be housing insecure, and even when evictions don't lead to homelessness, eviction itself is a traumatic experience that has many negative impacts. The story my project will tell is about evictions in Allegheny County, and how they correlate with rent and property values increasing, how they impact other social services, and how landlords are more likely to evict children and Black people. 

### visualizations and sketches

The story will begin with a line chart of evictions in Allegheny County over time. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8763651"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Then I will show the change in property values over time in Allegheny County zip codes that have a lot of evictions (I still need to figure out how I will define "a lot" by going through the data). The purpose of this chart will be to illustrate growth in property owner wealth, as rents increase even when properties don't transact, and how it tracks with housing insecurity. 

The 10 zip codes with most eviction filings: 15221, 15235, 15146, 15206, 15202, 15205, 15212, 15236, 15025, 15210. These zip codes experienced the highest average property value increase since 2017?

I will also show race and eviction, as well as a map of neighborhoods that have a lot of evictions alongside Pittsburgh's original redlining map. This is not an original idea, as the right hand map is a screenshot from the Eviction Lab, but I will recreate this visual because I think it will be good, doable practice in GIS, and I think it could be really powerful storytelling if I critiqued it by design.

I'll make another line chart to show evictions in areas that have a lot of children (same "a lot" caveat as above) and write a narrative about the impacts of eviction on children.

I will end the story with some stacked bars that show 211 calls over time. This is a great proxy for need because of 211 definition here.

The call to action will be to create a push for a comprehensive eviction diversion program, like [the one that exists in Philadelphia](https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/About), which requires landlords to participate in mediation before evicting their tenants.
